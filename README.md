# 📊 HR Analytics Dashboard – Workforce, Compensation & Attrition Insights


This project analyzes a comprehensive workforce dataset comprising nearly 9,000 employees across seven departments within a mid-sized U.S. professional services company. Using Tableau, I designed an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard that connects hiring trends, demographic patterns, performance ratings, compensation data, and attrition behavior into one unified decision-making tool for TalentEdge Solutions HR and executive leaders.

The goal of the project was to uncover the drivers of employee turnover, highlight pay and performance disparities, and provide actionable insights to improve retention, talent development, and workforce planning.
